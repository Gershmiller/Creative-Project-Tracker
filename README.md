# Creative Project Tracker for Neurodiverse Creatives

A single-page web application designed specifically for neurodiverse creatives and non-linear thinkers who are navigating the complex intersection of AI tools and creative software. This application helps track interconnected creative journeys and identify skill development opportunities in a visually engaging way.

## Features

### Non-Linear Project Tracking
- Flexible status indicators beyond simple 'percent complete'
- Visual connections showing how skills interrelate across projects
- Space for documenting learning resources, inspirations, and roadblocks

### Unique Features for Neurodiverse Creatives
- **Skill Galaxy Visualization**: Interactive visualization showing how different skills connect across projects
- **Inspiration Capture**: Features for saving spontaneous ideas and creative tangents
- **Energy Level Tracking**: Monitor your creative energy levels to work with your natural rhythms
- **Non-prescriptive Progress Tracking**: Avoids inducing shame or pressure
- **Visual Roadblock Tagging**: Different types of roadblocks (technical learning, creative block, etc.)
- **Chaos Mode**: Optional mode that presents projects in a more organic, less structured format
